                    <b>Y</b>ou don’t need a crystal ball to tell you that the past two years have been a whirlwind, to
                    say
                    the least. No matter how hard some people have tried to separate themselves from the Collective, the
                    pandemic — along with political, social, and economic changes — became a bridge for us to
                    acknowledge
                    that we are all breathing and operating under the same energy. The last two years have shown us all
                    that
                    no matter how much money or access you have to material resources, the human collective is one. When
                    you
                    strip us of all objects and titles that validate our existence, we are all just souls having a human
                    experience and no matter how you choose to live out that experience, none of us are exempt from the
                    circle of life.
                    Many of us used this time to seek or to pursue answers to questions that have been stored deep
                    within
                    our being.
                    “Why am I here?”
                    “What is my purpose?”
                    “How can I get closer to that purpose?”
                    “How can I make sense of what’s happening in the world?”
                    I know this to be true because there was nearly a 50% increase in my business. In fact, Marie Claire
                    wrote a whole article about spiritual practitioners leaving their 9-to-5s to pivot full-time into
                    spirit
                    work. (Full disclosure: I’m quoted in that article.) With minimal distractions and influence from
                    the
                    external world, we had more time to explore our spiritual curiosity without religious pressures and
                    regardless of upbringing. For many, this pandemic time offered the first opportunity to disconnect
                    from
                    daily distractions by unmasking ourselves and exploring different healing modalities such as tarot,
                    astrology (the first science to ever exist!), energy healing, crystal healing, divination tools, and
                    more. All without having someone in our ear to cross-examine our natural curiosities by casting
                    spells
                    of fear, doubt, and shame.

                    If you’re reading this right now, there’s a part of you that is seeking more and it’s okay to
                    acknowledge it; your spiritual beliefs or practices don’t have to be shared with the world. This is
                    for
                    your own personal healing and spiritual well-being. This budding curiosity and faith in the divine
                    are
                    bringing us together at this moment through the world of spirituality and healing, and with this
                    two-part offering, I’m here to be a vessel and guide you to grounding yourself in preparation for
                    2022.
                    I’ll be tapping in with our guides and pulling some messages to direct us on how to remain centered
                    and
                    rooted so that we can face the year ahead with confidence. Now, let’s see how the divine is
                    suggesting
                    we get in tune mentally and spiritually.

                    For mental grounding, the cards to consider are Justice and Sanctuary
                    We must all understand the spiritual law of cause and effect, aka karma, and how that impacts us
                    individually. The Law of Cause and Effect teaches us that with every action there is a reaction and
                    one
                    cannot escape the response from the Universe. We can all attest it can take time for those actions
                    to
                    catch up to someone, especially when it seems like abusers or harmful people in positions of power
                    seem
                    to remain unscathed. But, we don’t *really* know what’s happening behind the scenes; sometimes karma
                    catches up to us on an emotional level — like, imagine having all of the material wealth one could
                    ever
                    have but you still wake up in internal chaos, unhappy and unfulfilled? No thank you! Some people
                    believe
                    that money can buy happiness, but it cannot buy peace. It will give you access to things that could
                    direct you to a peaceful environment, but if your soul is heavy, the only way to lighten your
                    internal
                    world is by correcting your wrongs, apologizing, practicing forgiveness, holding yourself and others
                    accountable, and so on.
                    Spirit wants us to familiarize ourselves with this spiritual law to share with us that our thoughts
                    become real things. There’s an old spiritual saying “Where attention goes, energy flows,” that
                    recognizes the divine power we each have to manifest our thoughts or conversations into the material
                    world. Take account of the thoughts you have and conversations you have and how those words or
                    thoughts
                    will return back to you through the law of karma. Are your thoughts manifesting a positive or
                    negative
                    reality?
                    Some people don’t adhere to these laws because it holds them accountable for situations they’d
                    rather
                    make themselves a victim to or would rather hold tight to narratives that negate free will. We take
                    our
                    power back by honoring free will and our own inherent power and spiritual responsibility. There is a
                    weighted responsibility of truth; Spirit speaks of being an advocate for the truth and acknowledging
                    your own truths in order to return to a state of peace.
